                                This is the hieroglyphic for 'Beekeeper'.
                                Beekeeping is an ancient art that has been practiced for thousands of years.
                                There are even jars of edible honey buried with Ancient Egyptian Pharaohs.

                                We thought that an icon that symbolised care for bees and ancient african wisdom was fitting.
                                Bees are humanities greatest friends among the insects.

                                Uganda has enormous untapped potential for Bee- keeping. Uganda currently harvests only 1% of a potential 500,000 tonnes of honey per year. 
                                Despite being only one of five countries in sub-Saharan Africa licenced to export honey to the EU, Uganda has failed to meet home-grown demands for honey, let alone export to this potential market.

                                Deborah Ruth Amulen, a lecturer at Makerere University currently a PhD student of Ghent University, also studying at Bangor University, said: "There is still hope for beekeeping in Uganda, since farmers are very interested, they only need the right blend of support to succeed.
                                Besides the high unemployment among these communities makes them yearn for meaningful livelihood alternatives and in the spirit of climate smart agriculture, beekeeping is a suitable choice."

                                <p style={{ fontSize: "1.33em" }}>
                                Smagghe of Ghent University, said: "Yes indeed there is much of potential especially in northern Uganda honey to market as organic honey to Europe. 
                                Our research demonstrated that this honey is free of pesticide residues. So this extra income can sustain also a stable social community. 
                                The successful communities we visited in Kitgum for instance, can work as examples for the whole area. 
                                However, there is need for more and better on-going training in good beekeeping practices and diseases monitoring and control.
