// Here we will outline, the 'Honey Drop' buisness model.
//               We produce small batches of honey, and then we only select the finest white-capped comb to bottle.
//               Due to this, when we sell out, we sell out. All of our honey will be single origin, allowing you to experince the taste nature in that particular region

                                In June of 2021, in the midst of a Global Pandemic, I quit my job as a Software Engineer at an Investment Bank in London and decided to move back home (Kampala, Uganda) and pursue my passion of full-time beekeeping !
                                I completed a beekeeping training course at Hackney City Farm.

                              Not at all, I've been interested in Systems since I can remember, this lead me down a career path dealing with large distributed systems, but the first systems I ever marvelled at were all natural.

                              We used to knock over termite mounds on the playground and watch them. I saw them all collect their eggs and descend deeper into the ground. I used to wonder, How can they all know what to do at the same time, when I, a distinguished and most-excellent seven year old human, don't know what I'm doing most of the time ?
                            </p>

                              I'm still looking for answers, and while looking I stumbled upon what may be the most incredible system on the planet. The Honeybee Hive. A spatially-distributed and decentralised super-organism that creates it's own food.

                                  I'm also not the first to find these creatures to be amazing, if we look back through history, the honey bee is prominent across ages and cultures. there's a whole book in the Quran called the Bee, The land of milk and honey in the bible, the bee being the symbol of the king of egypt,
